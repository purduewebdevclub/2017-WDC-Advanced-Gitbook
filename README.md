* Scope
* Passing data between components
* Built-in directives
* Services
* Observables w/ HTTP
* Client-Side Routing


## How does this work?
This is part of the content for the Advanced Track.
We have slides in addition to this gitbook. You should attend all of the meetings and follow allow using the gitbook.

### What if I miss a meeting?
No problem! We know you can be busy, so we built this gitbook just for you! Just follow along and you should be able to get caught up for the week!

### Why should I attend the lessons? Don't I have access to all the material?
Good question. Showing up to the lessons gives you:
* Access to extra material
* Ability to ask questions
* Ability to ask for help
* Presentation provided by our best instructors

Currently still WIP.
